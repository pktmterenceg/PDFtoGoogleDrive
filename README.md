# PDF to Google Drive 


**PDF to Google Drive** is a PDF workflow for Mac OS X. 

It allows you to push content from the Mac OS print-to-PDF option directly to a folder in Google Drive. 


## PDF Workflows

[PDF Workflows](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Printing/Conceptual/PDF_Workflow/pdfwf_concepts/pdfwf_concepts.html) are the additional options that appear in the "PDF" drop-down menu in the lower left corner of the Mac OS X print dialog.

## Requirements
Requirements:

- **gdrive** tool for interacting with Google Drive  from the command-line. [https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive) (Tip: remember to run it first once to authorize it within the Google Drive ecosystem.)

- **terminal notifier** tool to allow for creating Notifications from the command-line. [https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) This allows the workflow to create a notification when the PDF has been successfully pushed to Google Drive.
